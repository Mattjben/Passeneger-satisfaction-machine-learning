# Machine learning to predict airline customer satisfaction

### **Data:** 

The US airline passenger satisfaction survey dataset was sourced from kaggle, uploaded by John D 2018. This dataset contains survey results for whether a customer was satisfied with the flight or not as well as passenger and flight information. The dataset also contains information on what parts of the flight service they were satisfied with or not satisifed with.

- satisfaction.xlsx/sat_csv_orig.csv: orginal dataset
- satisfaction_cleaned_5000_v2.csv: cleaned and sampled data used for machine learning
- Phase 1_Airplane.ipynb/html : Notebook of phase 1 of the report 
- Phase 2.ipynb/html : Notebook of phase 2 of the report 

### **Phase 1**: Data preparation and visualisation
Phase 1 of this report primarily consisted of preparing, analysing, and visualising U.S. airline passenger satisfaction survey data. This was carried out in an effort to improve the dataâ€™s overall usability and understand the key characteristics and trends present

**OUTPUT:** satisfaction_cleaned_5000_v2.csv

### **Phase 2**: Predictive modelling
Development and evaluation of six binary classification machine learning models (including neural network) to predict whether or not a customer if satisfied. This is futher optimised using feature selection , hyperparamter tuning etc.
