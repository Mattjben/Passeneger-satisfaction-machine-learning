# Submission Instructions

**NOTE 1:** Canvas can occasionally become a rather unreliable piece of software, unfortunately. So please follow all technical submission instructions for your assessments so that we can correctly identify your files for marking purposes. Thank you.

**NOTE 2:** If you have 2 or 3 members in your group, then ONLY ONE of the members must make the submission.

**NOTE 3:** For both reports, please make sure you include your group name as well as full name(s) and student ID(s) of all group members (EVEN IF you are the only person in the group). Thank you.

**WARNING:** We cannot run plagiarism check software on zipped submissions, so zipped submissions will NOT be marked and they will not receive any points.

Suppose you are in Group 23.

**For Phase 1:** You need submit the following 3 files (please do not zip them):

- Phase1_Group23.csv (your Phase 1 input data as a single CSV file. The idea here is that we should be able to replicate your Phase 1 results successfully by running your notebook with this input CSV file.)
- Phase1_Group23.ipynb (your Jupyter notebook file)
- Phase1_Group23.html (an HTML file directly compiled from your Jupyter notebook file)

**For Phase 2:** You need submit the following 3 files (please do not zip them):

- Phase2_Group23.csv (your Phase 2 input data as a single CSV file. The idea here is that we should be able to replicate your Phase 2 results successfully by running your notebook with this input CSV file.)
- Phase2_Group23.ipynb
- Phase2_Group23.html
- **Important Phase 2 Note:**
  - Please do NOT include your Phase 1 reports or its contents with your Phase 2 submissions. You can, however, make some changes with your Phase 1 tasks if you need to, and then ONLY include these changes with your Phase 2 report with some explanation for these changes.

**NOTE 4:** Canvas File Renaming: If you resubmit a file on Canvas, say a file called "Phase1_Group23.html", Canvas will rename it to "Phase1_Group23-2.html" in the second submission, and then to "Phase1_Group23-3.html" in the third submission, etc. That will be OK as far as file naming is concerned, because this is how Canvas works.
