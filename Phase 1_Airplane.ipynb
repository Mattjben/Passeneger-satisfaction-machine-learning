    "\n",
    "The US airline passenger satisfaction survey dataset was sourced from kaggle, uploaded by John D 2018. This dataset contains survey results for whether a customer was satisfied with the flight or not as well as passenger and flight information. The dataset also contains information on what parts of the flight service they were satisfied with or not satisifed with.\n",

    "URL: [US Airline Passenger Satisfaction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johndddddd/customer-satisfaction)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Dataset details:** <a name=\"dd\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains information on whether customers were satisfied or not during there domestic flight within the USA. There is personal details of each trveller including age, gender, type of travel (personal or buisness) as well as information of the flight including inflight duration, gate departure and if the flight is delayed. There is also a rating for which cutomers rated certain aspects of the flight such as inflight wifi, cleanliness, leg room and other things. These features are then used for a classification problem to predict the target feature of whether a customer will be satisfied or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has 24 features including the target feature and 129880 observations before any pre processing is done to the dataset.\n",

Therefore these airline surveys are very important becauase they can help generate models that help to determine what the most important features of an airlines service are the most important to which kind of person. This allows an airline to priotise spending into specific sectors of thier buisness and ensures they offer the best service to the most people and which parts of there service they can save money and scale down while having a minimal impact on customer satisfaction.\n",
